RiskAversion are different between candidates
hyperparameters for PainAvoidance increases with risk, as expected.
can also see this patters looking at the individual plots
tau is maxed out, I'm assuming this ib bÃ¦d.

PPC: 2852+608 correct, 252+237 wrong -> 3460/(3460+489) = 0.876 ratio correct
also predicts subjects that did not change bahaviour well
(3, 12, 15, 19, 23)

At this point it is worth noting that most subjects have a strong preference for gambling than not, what parameterscan reflect this?

PainAvoidance has a weird thinng with being predicted as zero for low/med risk
then very high uncertainty for high risk.
RiskAversion is predicted as more or less the same for each candidate.

PPC: 1882+449 correct, 937+411 wrong -> 0.633 ration correct

 - const_i
Not good model, half of true gambles are predicted as safe bets.
Seems to predict safe bets well, most likely because the model is inclined to predict safe

plots:
RiskAversion seems very similar between subjects
most PainAvoidance is between 0-2 with some up to 4
Good spread, but doesn't seem to help model predict well
Tau does not seem to reveal any patterns

PPC: 1342 + 819 correct, 1477 + 41 wrong -> 0.587 ratio correct
