Intro
    our goal:
        implementing model for authors hypothesis
        creating own hypothesis and compare to author's
            maximizing likelihood for our hypothesis -> create best model
Problem/experiment
    pain vs money
describe:
    authors models | Aversion-Reward Conflic
        theory: deviation from mean reward predicts response
    our models | Risk Aversion
        theory: standard RA-model with modification for pain instead of loss
choosing our best model:
    describe how we ended up with const_h_noT
    that means: why no other?
    exp and pow -> const => chose const model
        needed to initialize those extra parameters manually
    no_T performs similarly
    - experienceof pain doesn't change
    future: savage dickey
comparing our best model with author's models:
    BIC similar + LOOIC/PPC different: | our const_h and author model2
        hover around the same mode, but different confidence in prediction
    loss is qualitatively a different thing, so perhaps standard RA-model is not best


include for things
result:
    present posteriors
present:
    BIC
    LOOIC
    PPC
    Parameter - Recovery if Done else Drop
analyse/conlclude:
    exp -> const => chose const model
    no_T performs similarly
    BIC similar + LOOIC/PPC different: | our const_h and author model2
        hover around the same mode, but different confidence in prediction
    loss is qualitatively a different thing, so perhaps standard RA-model is not best
future:
    Parameter recovery if not Done
